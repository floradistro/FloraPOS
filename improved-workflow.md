# Flora POS Improved Development Workflow

## 🎯 Current Architecture
```
Flora POS (Next.js) ←→ WordPress API ←→ Admin App
     ↓                      ↓              ↓
   Vercel              api.floradistro.com  Vercel
```

## 🚀 Improved Workflow

### 1. Branch Strategy
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── feature/pos-inventory-sync
├── feature/admin-reporting
├── feature/wordpress-plugin-x
└── hotfix/critical-bug
```

### 2. Development Environment
```
Local Development:
├── WordPress (localhost:8081) ← Clone of live site
├── Flora POS (localhost:3000) ← Points to local WordPress
├── Admin App (localhost:3001) ← Points to local WordPress
└── All plugins developed locally
```

### 3. Automated Pipeline
```
1. Develop locally → 2. Push to branch → 3. Auto-deploy to staging → 4. Test → 5. Merge to main → 6. Auto-deploy to production
```
