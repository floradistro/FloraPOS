# Performance Optimizations - October 14, 2025

## 🎯 Summary
Restored pricing tiers, fixed restock mode, and optimized loading speed from 5-10 seconds to ~500ms.

---

## 1. ⚡ PRICING TIERS - RESTORED & OPTIMIZED

### Problem
- After bulk optimizations, pricing tiers were disabled
- Category ID type mismatch (string vs number) prevented assignments

### Solution
```typescript
// Fixed type coercion in blueprint assignment matching
parseInt(assignment.category_id.toString()) === parseInt(categoryId.toString())

// Re-enabled batch pricing fetch in ProductGrid
const batchPricingResponse = await BlueprintPricingService.getBlueprintPricingBatch(...)
```

### Files Changed
- `src/app/api/pricing/batch-blueprint/route.ts` (lines 374, 5)
- `src/components/ui/ProductGrid.tsx` (lines 520-544)

### Performance Impact
- ✅ Pricing tiers: 38/38 products
- ⚡ Load time: +300ms (acceptable for critical feature)
- 💾 Cache: 2 minutes (increased from 10 seconds)

---

## 2. 📦 RESTOCK MODE - FIXED

### Problem
- Only showing 38 in-stock products
- Restock requires seeing ALL products (including out-of-stock) to create purchase orders

### Solution
```php
// WordPress plugin: flora-inventory-matrix/includes/api/class-flora-im-bulk-api.php

// Accept restock_mode parameter
$restock_mode = $request->get_param('restock_mode') === 'true';

// Skip stock filtering for restock mode
if (!$restock_mode && $total_stock <= 0) {
    continue; // Skip only in POS mode
}
```

### Files Changed
- `flora-inventory-matrix/includes/api/class-flora-im-bulk-api.php` (lines 73-75, 133-135, 281-289)
- Deployed to: `https://api.floradistro.com` ✅

### Results
- ✅ Restock mode: 107 products (69 out-of-stock + 38 in-stock)
- ✅ POS mode: 38 in-stock products (unchanged)
- ✅ Audit mode: 38 in-stock products (unchanged)

---

## 3. 🔧 VARIABLE PRODUCTS - FULLY WORKING

### Problem
- Variable products not appearing in bulk API
- SQL query didn't detect variable product type
- Parent products have 0 stock (stock is at variant level)

### Solution
```php
// Improved SQL to detect variable products
CASE 
    WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM wp_posts p2 
        WHERE p2.post_parent = p.ID 
        AND p2.post_type = 'product_variation' 
        AND p2.post_status = 'publish'
    ) THEN 'variable'
    ELSE COALESCE(pm_type.meta_value, 'simple')
END as type

// Always include variable products
if (!$restock_mode && !$is_variable && $total_stock <= 0) {
    continue; // Skip only simple products with no stock
}
```

### Files Changed
- `flora-inventory-matrix/includes/api/class-flora-im-bulk-api.php` (lines 90-118, 281-289)
- Deployed to production ✅

### Results
- ✅ 4 variable products now appear
- ✅ Golden Hour, Day Drinker, Darkside, Riptide
- ✅ Each shows "0 parent stock" (correct behavior)

---

## 4. ⚡ LAZY VARIANT LOADING - MASSIVE SPEED IMPROVEMENT

### Problem
- Loading ALL variants eagerly on initial load
- 4 variable products × 5 variants each = 20+ API calls
- Each variant: WooCommerce API + inventory batch
- Total load time: 5-10 seconds

### Solution
```typescript
// BEFORE: Eager loading (slow)
const normalizedProducts = await Promise.all(
  baseProducts.map(async (product) => {
    if (product.type === 'variable') {
      const variants = await loadVariantsForProduct(product.id);
      // ... 20+ API calls on mount
    }
  })
);

// AFTER: Lazy loading (fast)
const normalizedProducts = baseProducts.map(product => {
  if (product.type === 'variable') {
    product.has_variants = true;
    product.variants = []; // Load on-demand when clicked
  }
  return product;
});

// Load variants when product is clicked
const handleProductSelection = async (product) => {
  if (product.has_variants && product.variants.length === 0) {
    const loadedVariants = await loadVariantsForProduct(product.id);
    // Update product with variants
  }
};
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/ui/AdjustmentsGrid.tsx` (lines 416-448, 203-239)
- `src/components/ui/ProductGrid.tsx` (lines 725-754)

### Performance Impact
- ⚡ Initial load: **500ms** (was 5-10 seconds)
- ⚡ **10-20x faster**
- ⚡ Variant load on-demand: ~300ms
- 🎯 Only loads variants you actually view

---

## 5. 💾 AGGRESSIVE CACHING

### Changes
```typescript
// Blueprint Pricing Cache: 2 minutes (was 10 seconds)
const CACHE_DURATION = 120000;

// API Client Cache: 10 minutes (was 5)
async getBlueprintPricing(products) {
  return this.post('/api/pricing/batch-blueprint', { products }, {
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000
  });
}
```

### Performance Impact
- ⚡ Repeated view switching: Instant (cached)
- ⚡ Pricing data: Shared across all views
- 🔄 Fresh data: Every 2 minutes automatically

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### API Endpoints Modified
1. `/api/proxy/flora-im/products/bulk` - Now supports `restock_mode=true` parameter
2. `/api/pricing/batch-blueprint` - Improved caching (2 min)
3. `/api/inventory/batch` - Used for variant inventory (unchanged)

### Caching Strategy
- **Blueprint assignments**: 2 minutes server-side cache
- **Blueprint pricing rules**: 2 minutes server-side cache  
- **API client cache**: 10 minutes client-side cache
- **React Query cache**: Default (stale after 5 minutes)

### Lazy Loading Strategy
- Products: Loaded immediately (bulk API)
- Pricing tiers: Loaded immediately (batch API)
- Variants: Loaded on-demand (when product clicked)
- Variant inventory: Loaded with variants (batch API)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Variable products show "0 parent stock"** - This is CORRECT
   - Stock exists at variant level only
   - Click product to see variant inventory

2. **First click on variable product has ~300ms delay** - This is expected
   - Loading variants from WooCommerce API
   - Subsequent views are instant (cached in state)

3. **Pricing tier cache is 2 minutes**
   - If you update pricing rules, wait 2 min or hard refresh
   - Or increment CACHE_VERSION to force reload
