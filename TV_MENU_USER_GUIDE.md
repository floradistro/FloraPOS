## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Wait for the toast** - Loading toasts turn into success/error toasts in 1-3 seconds
2. **Watch the status dots** - They update every 5-10 seconds automatically
3. **Use "Refresh TV List"** - If you don't see a TV, click the refresh button
4. **Network TVs only** - Push Config only works on online network TVs (green dot)

## Troubleshooting

### "No online TVs found" toast
- Check if TVs are actually online (green dot)
- Try clicking "Refresh TV List" button
- TVs must have been online within the last 20 seconds

### Push Config not working
- Ensure the TV has a green dot (online)
- Wait for the success/error toast
- Check console for detailed logs

### TV not appearing
- Wait 10 seconds for automatic refresh
- Click "Refresh TV List" button
- Ensure TV display page is open and not minimized

## Command Execution Flow

```
You Click Button
    ‚Üì

## Real-Time Updates

The system uses multiple layers for reliability:

1. **Supabase Real-time** - Instant WebSocket updates
2. **5-Second Polling** - Backup in case WebSocket drops
3. **10-Second Heartbeats** - Keeps status fresh

This means even if one method fails, the others will keep working.

## Visual Feedback Colors

- **Green** = Success (config pushed, refresh sent)
- **Red** = Error (command failed, TV offline)
- **Gray** = Loading (action in progress)
- **Blue** = Info (general notifications)

All toasts auto-dismiss after 3 seconds, so you don't need to close them manually.
