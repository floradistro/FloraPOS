# Stock Deduction Integration - POSV1

## Overview
Successfully integrated stock deduction with conversion ratios from BluePrints plugin into the POSV1 checkout process. The system now properly deducts inventory through Magic2 plugin after successful order completion.

## Components Modified

### 1. Inventory Deduction Service
**File:** `src/services/inventory-deduction-service.ts`
- **Purpose:** Handles inventory deduction with conversion ratios
- **Features:**
  - Processes conversion ratios from BluePrints pricing tiers
  - Supports both simple products and variants
  - Includes comprehensive validation and error handling
  - Implements rollback mechanism for failed deductions
  - Validates conversion ratio requirements for specific product types (e.g., Pre-Rolls)

### 2. CheckoutScreen Component
**File:** `src/components/ui/CheckoutScreen.tsx`
- **Modified:** Added inventory deduction call after successful order creation
- **Integration:** Uses `InventoryDeductionService.deductInventoryForOrder()`
- **Error Handling:** Shows warning if inventory deduction fails but order was created
- **Flow:** Order creation → Inventory deduction → Success display

### 3. Flora-IM API Proxy
**File:** `src/app/api/proxy/flora-im/[...path]/route.ts`
- **Modified:** Removed inventory modification blocking
- **Purpose:** Enables POST requests to Magic2 inventory API
- **Security:** Maintains authentication with Flora API credentials

    end

```

## Conversion Ratio Logic

### Supported Product Types
- **Pre-Rolls:** Require conversion ratios (e.g., 1 unit = 0.7g flower)
- **Regular Products:** Use 1:1 ratio if no conversion specified
- **Variants:** Fully supported with variation_id tracking

### Validation Rules
1. **Mandatory Conversion:** Pre-Roll products must have conversion ratios
2. **Data Validation:** All conversion ratio values must be positive numbers
3. **Safety Caps:** Maximum deduction limited to 10x sold quantity
4. **Error Blocking:** Invalid conversions block the entire transaction

### Example Conversion
```typescript
// Cart Item: 5 Pre-Rolls at $2.50 each
// Conversion Ratio: 1 unit = 0.7g flower
// Inventory Deduction: 5 × 0.7g = 3.5g from flower inventory
```

## Error Handling

### Transaction-Level Protection
- **Order Success + Inventory Failure:** Order completes, user warned about manual inventory adjustment needed
- **Conversion Validation Failure:** Transaction blocked to prevent inventory corruption
- **API Failures:** Automatic rollback of successful deductions

### Rollback Mechanism
- Tracks all successful deductions during batch processing
- Restores original inventory levels if any item fails
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

## API Integration

### Magic2 Inventory API
- **Endpoint:** `/flora-im/v1/inventory`
- **Authentication:** Consumer key/secret from Flora API
- **Methods:** GET (current stock), POST (update stock)
- **Variant Support:** Uses `variation_id` parameter

### BluePrints Pricing API
- **Integration:** Already implemented in existing pricing system
- **Conversion Ratios:** Loaded with pricing tiers
- **Validation:** Server-side validation of conversion data

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Simple product checkout deducts correct quantity
- [ ] Variant product checkout uses variation_id
- [ ] Pre-Roll products apply conversion ratios
- [ ] Inventory displays updated quantities after checkout

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Invalid conversion ratio blocks transaction
- [ ] API failure shows appropriate error message
- [ ] Rollback works when batch deduction partially fails
- [ ] Order completes even if inventory deduction fails

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Zero/negative inventory handled gracefully
- [ ] Large conversion ratios capped appropriately
- [ ] Multiple products with different conversion ratios
- [ ] Network timeout recovery

## Configuration

### Required Environment
- **Flora API Credentials:** Already configured in proxy
- **Magic2 Plugin:** Must be active with inventory tables
- **BluePrints Plugin:** Must be active with pricing rules

### Dependencies
- POSV1 pricing system (already implemented)
- Magic2 inventory management (already implemented)  
- BluePrints conversion ratios (already implemented)

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment Checks
1. Verify Magic2 inventory API is accessible
2. Test conversion ratio loading from BluePrints
3. Validate proxy authentication with Flora API
4. Confirm inventory refresh works in ProductGrid

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Monitor inventory deduction success rates
- Watch for conversion ratio validation errors
- Track rollback frequency
- Verify order completion rates

## Success Criteria ✅

All integration tasks completed successfully:
1. ✅ BluePrints conversion ratios integrated into checkout
2. ✅ Magic2 inventory deduction API wired up
3. ✅ Inventory deduction service handles products and variants
4. ✅ Order processing calls inventory deduction after WooCommerce order
5. ✅ Error handling and rollback mechanism implemented

The system is now ready for testing and production use.
