# ✅ CHECKOUT SYSTEM - COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Double Charging (99% Tax) - FIXED
**Problem**: Orders charged $59.68 instead of $32.39  
**Cause**: WooCommerce had "Big Tax" (99%) configured  
**Fix**: Deleted via API, created 8% NC Sales Tax  
**Result**: Orders now calculate correctly

### 2. ✅ Inventory Cache Hell - FIXED
**Problem**: Inventory showing 0 even after setting to 100  
**Cause**: Multi-layer caching (proxy 5s + browser + React Query)  
**Fix**: 
  - Backend proxy: Disabled cache for inventory
  - Frontend V2 service: Bypasses proxy entirely, goes direct to WordPress
  - Unique timestamps with random numbers
  - Verification step after each update
**Result**: Real-time inventory data

### 3. ✅ Products Disappearing - FIXED  
**Problem**: Products vanish when sold out  
**Cause**: Flora IM bulk API filtered products with stock <= 0  
**Fix**: Disabled stock filtering in WordPress plugin  
**Result**: All products visible even with 0 stock

### 4. ✅ Wrong Location - FIXED
**Problem**: Deducting from wrong location  
**Cause**: Using hardcoded LOCATION_MAPPINGS  
**Fix**: Now uses `user.location_id` from logged-in user  
**Result**: Deducts from Charlotte Central (Location 20)

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: HARD REFRESH Browser
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### Step 2: Make a Test Sale

**Product**: Watermelon Gummy  
**Starting Inventory**: 50 units  
**Sell**: 1 unit  
**Expected Result**: 49 units remaining

### Step 3: Watch Console Logs

**Should See**:
```
🔥 V2 INVENTORY DEDUCTION - ZERO CACHE
📦 Processing 1 items at location 20
🔄 Processing: Watermelon Gummy (ID: 676, Qty: 1)
  🌐 Fetching inventory (bypassing cache)...
  📊 Current stock: 50.00
  ➖ Deducting: 1
  📝 New stock: 49.00
  🔧 Updating inventory to 49...
  ✅ Verified: Inventory is now 49
  ✅ Updated: 50 → 49
✅ All 1 items deducted successfully
```

**Should NOT See**:
```
❌ 📊 Current stock: 0.00  ← This means cache issue!
❌ ⚠️ OVERSELLING  ← This means reading wrong stock
```

### Step 4: Verify in WordPress

1. Go to WooCommerce → Orders
2. Find your test order
3. Check:
   - ✅ Total: ~$32 (not $60)
   - ✅ Tax: ~$2.40 (not $30)
   - ✅ Location: Charlotte Central
   - ✅ Status: Completed

## 📊 Test Inventory Set

Current inventory at **Location 20 (Charlotte Central)**:
- Watermelon Gummy (676): **50 units**
- Snickerdoodle (691): **100 units**  
- Shatter Gas Fudge (41234): **30 units**

---

## 🎯 What Should Happen Now

### ✅ Correct Behavior
```
1. Add Watermelon Gummy to cart (shows 50 in stock)
2. Complete checkout
3. Console shows: "Current stock: 50.00"
4. Inventory updates: 50 → 49
5. Product card refreshes: shows "49 in stock"
6. Product STAYS VISIBLE (doesn't disappear)
7. Order total: $32.39 (not $59.68)
```

### ❌ If Still Broken
```
If you see:
- "Current stock: 0.00" → Cache still not cleared
- Inventory goes to 0 → Cache returning stale data
- Total is $60 → Tax rate issue
- Product disappears → WordPress plugin not updated

Then:
1. Hard refresh browser AGAIN
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Check WordPress plugin file was uploaded
4. Verify opcache was cleared
```
