# ForwardRef Fix for Dynamic Imports

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **Problem**
React warning: "Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?"

### **Root Cause**
Next.js dynamic imports don't properly preserve `forwardRef` when components are lazy-loaded. The `ProductGrid` component uses `forwardRef` internally, but when imported via `dynamic()`, the ref forwarding was lost.

### **Error Stack Trace**
```
at LoadableComponent (<anonymous>)
at ProductGrid 
at HomePage (page.tsx:62:55)
```

### **Solution Implemented**
Created a forwardRef wrapper specifically for the dynamically imported ProductGrid:

```typescript
// Create a forwardRef wrapper for ProductGrid to fix the ref warning
const ProductGridWithRef = React.forwardRef<
  { refreshInventory: () => Promise<void> }, 
  React.ComponentProps<typeof ProductGrid>
>((props, ref) => (
  <ProductGrid {...props} ref={ref} />
));
ProductGridWithRef.displayName = 'ProductGridWithRef';
```

### **Changes Made**
1. **Created wrapper component** with proper forwardRef
2. **Added proper TypeScript typing** for ref and props
3. **Set displayName** for better debugging
4. **Updated JSX usage** to use the wrapper instead of direct component

### **Files Modified**
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Added ProductGridWithRef wrapper and updated usage

### **Verification**
- ✅ Build passes without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Tests still pass (4/4 passing)
- ✅ No breaking changes to functionality
- ✅ Ref functionality preserved

### **Why This Approach**
1. **Minimal Impact**: Only affects the specific problematic component
2. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript typing maintained
3. **Functionality**: Preserves all existing ref functionality
4. **Performance**: No performance impact, just a thin wrapper
5. **Compatibility**: Works with Next.js dynamic imports

### **Result**
The forwardRef warning is now resolved, and the ProductGrid component can properly receive and use refs when dynamically imported. The `productGridRef` functionality for inventory refreshing continues to work as expected.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - ForwardRef warning eliminated while preserving all functionality
