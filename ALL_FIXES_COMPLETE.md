# ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETE - READY TO TEST

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Deleted Old Inventory Service  
**Old file deleted**: `inventory-deduction-service.ts` (510 lines of problematic code)

### 2. ✅ V2 Service is Now the Standard
**Renamed**: `inventory-deduction-service-v2.ts` → `inventory-deduction-service.ts`  
**Updated**: All imports now use the new service

### 3. ✅ Fixed CORS Issue
**Problem**: V2 was trying to call WordPress API directly (blocked by browser)  
**Solution**: Changed to use `/api/proxy/flora-im/` with aggressive cache busting

### 4. ✅ Tax Fixed
- Deleted "Big Tax" (99%)
- Created "NC Sales Tax" (8%)
- Orders now: $32.39 instead of $59.68

### 5. ✅ Products Don't Disappear
- Updated WordPress plugin
- Disabled stock filtering
- All products visible even with 0 stock

### 6. ✅ Location Fixed
- Uses `user.location_id` (20 = Charlotte Central)
- Inventory deducts from logged-in location

## 🔥 New Inventory Service Features

### Zero-Cache Design
```
Every request uses unique URL:
/api/proxy/flora-im/inventory?
  product_id=676
  &location_id=20
  &_nocache=1760643662.789123  ← Unique every time!
```

### Verification Step
```
1. GET current inventory
2. Calculate new value
3. POST update
4. Wait 500ms
5. GET again to VERIFY update worked
```

### Console Logs You'll See
```
