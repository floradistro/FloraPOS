3. **Manager Sign-Off**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting During Training

### "I can't find the cash management button"
**Solution:** Show left sidebar, verify they're logged in with correct permissions

### "The system won't let me open a drawer"
**Solution:** Check if another drawer is open at that location, must close first

### "My total doesn't match the system"
**Solution:** Recount using bill method, check for missed drops or transactions

### "I don't understand variance colors"
**Solution:** Use visual aid: Green = Good, Yellow = Okay (document why), Red = Problem (investigate now)

### "Bill counting takes too long"
**Solution:** Practice sorting first, then counting. Speed comes with repetition.
