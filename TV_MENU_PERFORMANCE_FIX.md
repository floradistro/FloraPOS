# TV Menu Slider Performance & Reliability Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **No User Feedback**
- **Problem**: Buttons like "Push Config" and "Refresh" had no visual feedback, leaving users uncertain if actions were working
- **Solution**: 
  - Added comprehensive Toast notification system
  - Loading toasts appear immediately when buttons are clicked
  - Success/error toasts confirm action completion
  - All button actions now provide clear visual feedback

### 2. **Very Slow Response**
- **Problem**: TVs were polling every 30 seconds, making the system feel sluggish
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced polling interval from 30s to 5s for command checks
  - Reduced heartbeat interval from 30s to 10s
  - Reduced TV list refresh from 30s to 5s
  - Made online/offline detection faster (20s threshold instead of 30s)

### 3. **TVs Showing Offline Until Refresh**
- **Problem**: TV status wasn't updating in real-time
- **Solution**:
  - Faster polling (5s instead of 30s)
  - Real-time Supabase subscriptions for instant updates
  - Stricter online detection (20s last_seen threshold)
  - Broadcast commands only target online TVs (checked server-side)

### 4. **Random Behavior & Reliability**
- **Problem**: Commands failing silently, no error handling
- **Solution**:
  - Added comprehensive error handling to all command methods
  - Commands throw errors to allow UI to handle them
  - Toast notifications show success/failure for every action
  - Better logging throughout the system

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
- `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` - Complete toast notification system with loading, success, error, and info states

### Modified Files

#### 1. `src/hooks/useTVRegistration.ts`
- Changed command polling from 30s to 5s
- Changed heartbeat from 30s to 10s
- Added logging for received commands

#### 2. `src/hooks/useTVDevices.ts`
- Changed refresh interval from 30s to 5s
- Changed online detection from 30s to 20s threshold
- Faster TV status updates

#### 3. `src/services/tv-command-service.ts`
- All methods now throw errors instead of returning null/false
- `broadcastToLocation()` now:
  - Returns number of TVs reached
  - Only targets online TVs (last_seen within 20s)
  - Server-side filtering for accuracy

#### 4. `src/components/ui/MenuView.tsx`
- Wrapped with `ToastProvider`
- Added `useToast` hook to all button handlers
- All buttons now show:
  - Loading toast on click
  - Success toast on completion
  - Error toast on failure
- Buttons affected:
  - Individual TV "Push Config" button
  - Individual TV "Refresh" button
  - "Refresh TV list" button
  - "Refresh All" button
  - "Push to Network TVs" button

#### 5. `src/app/menu-display/page.tsx`
- Added console logging for command reception
- Handles both `refresh_inventory` and `refresh` command types
- Better logging for debugging

## How It Works Now

### User Perspective
1. **Click any button** → Instant loading toast appears
2. **Command sent** → Background processing
3. **Within 1-5 seconds** → Success/error toast appears
4. **TV responds** → Action completes (refresh, theme update, etc.)

### Technical Flow
1. Button clicked → Loading toast shown
2. Command inserted into `tv_commands` table with `pending` status
3. TV's WebSocket receives instant notification
4. TV's 5s polling picks it up if WebSocket missed it
5. TV executes command and marks it complete
6. Success toast shown to user

### Performance Metrics
- **Before**: 30s to see TV status updates, no feedback on actions
- **After**: 5-10s for TV status, instant feedback on all actions

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Loading spinner toasts for all actions
- ✅ Success checkmark toasts with counts
- ✅ Error X toasts with clear messages
- ✅ Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

### Reliability
- ✅ Error handling on all commands
- ✅ Only send to online TVs
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ Retry mechanisms (5s polling backup)

### Speed
- ✅ 6x faster polling (5s vs 30s)
- ✅ 3x faster heartbeat (10s vs 30s)
- ✅ 1.5x stricter online detection (20s vs 30s)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Push config to single TV - shows loading then success toast
- [ ] Refresh single TV - shows loading then success toast
- [ ] Refresh TV list - shows loading then success toast
- [ ] Push to Network TVs - shows count of TVs reached
- [ ] Refresh All - shows count of local + network TVs
- [ ] TV goes offline - status updates within 20 seconds
- [ ] TV comes online - appears in list within 10 seconds
- [ ] Command fails - error toast appears

## Performance Notes

The system now uses a hybrid approach:
1. **Primary**: Supabase real-time subscriptions (instant)
2. **Backup**: 5-second polling (catches missed events)
3. **Heartbeat**: 10-second status updates (keeps online status fresh)

This ensures reliability even if WebSockets drop, while maintaining a responsive feel.

## Future Optimizations (Optional)

- Consider 3s polling for even faster response (trade-off: more DB load)
- Add command status tracking UI (pending/completed/failed)
- Add command history panel
- Add "Retry Failed" button for failed commands
