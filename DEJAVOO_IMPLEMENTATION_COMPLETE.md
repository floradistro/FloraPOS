## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migrations

#### A. WordPress Database (Production)
```bash
# SSH into production server
ssh user@your-production-server

# Run migration
mysql -u DB_USER -p DB_NAME < /path/to/flora-inventory-matrix/migrations/create-pos-terminals-tables.sql
```

Expected Output:
```
✅ POS Terminals & Payment Processors tables created successfully!
```

#### B. Supabase Database
```bash
cd /Users/whale/Desktop/FloraPOS-main

# Login to Supabase (if not already logged in)
supabase login

# Link to your project (if not already linked)
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Push migration
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Configure Dejavoo Processor

Make API call to create the Dejavoo processor configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-im/v1/payment-processors \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "processor_name": "Dejavoo Production",
    "processor_type": "dejavoo",
    "api_endpoint": "https://api.dejavoo.com",
    "api_version": "v1",
    "is_sandbox": 0,
    "supported_features": ["sale", "void", "return", "auth", "capture", "tip_adjust", "gift_card", "signature", "status", "settle"],
    "processor_settings": {
      "timeout": 120,
      "auto_settle": true,
      "print_receipt": true
    },
    "is_active": 1
  }'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "id": 1, "processor_name": "Dejavoo Production", ... },
  "message": "Processor created successfully"
}
```

### Step 3: Register POS Terminals

For **each physical WizarPOS QZ terminal** at your locations:

```bash
# Example: Charlotte Front Counter Terminal
curl -X POST https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-im/v1/pos-terminals \
  -H "Content-Type": application/json" \
  -d '{
    "terminal_name": "Charlotte Register 1",
    "terminal_serial": "WIZARPOS-CLT-001",
    "terminal_type": "dejavoo",
    "terminal_model": "wizarpos_qz",
    "location_id": 20,
    "workstation_name": "Front Counter",
    "processor_id": 1,
    "dejavoo_register_id": "YOUR_DEJAVOO_REGISTER_ID",
    "dejavoo_auth_key": "YOUR_DEJAVOO_AUTH_KEY",
    "status": "active",
    "features": ["contactless", "chip", "swipe", "gift_card"]
  }'
```

**Get your Dejavoo credentials from:**
- Dejavoo Merchant Portal
- Contact Dejavoo support
- Check terminal documentation

### Step 4: Deploy Code

```bash
# Deploy WordPress plugin updates
cd /Users/whale/Desktop/flora-inventory-matrix
# Upload to production server or push to git repo

# Deploy Next.js application
cd /Users/whale/Desktop/FloraPOS-main
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel or your hosting platform
```

### Step 5: Test with Physical Terminal

1. **Open POS application**
2. **Add item to cart**
3. **Proceed to checkout**
4. **Select "Card" payment method**
5. **Click "Process Order"**
6. **Wait for terminal to prompt for card**
7. **Present card to WizarPOS QZ terminal**
8. **Verify approval and order creation**

---

## 💳 How It Works

### Card Payment Flow

```
1. User selects "Card" payment method
   ↓
2. System checks for configured terminal
   ↓
3. User clicks "Process Order"
   ↓
4. Frontend calls dejavooPaymentService.processSale()
   ↓
5. Request sent to WordPress API endpoint
   ↓
6. WordPress sends sale request to Dejavoo SPIn API
   ↓
7. WizarPOS QZ terminal prompts for card
   ↓
8. Customer presents card (tap/insert/swipe)
   ↓
9. Dejavoo processes and returns response
   ↓
10. WordPress logs transaction in wp_flora_payment_transactions
   ↓
11. Frontend receives approval/decline
   ↓
12. If approved: Create WooCommerce order with transaction_ref
   ↓
13. Order includes terminal ID and transaction reference in meta_data
```

### Database Flow

```
Payment Transaction → wp_flora_payment_transactions
                          ↓
                      (stores full Dejavoo response)
                          ↓
WooCommerce Order → wp_posts (orders)
                          ↓
                      (stores transaction_ref in meta_data)
                          ↓
POS Order → wp_flora_im_pos_orders
                          ↓
                      (links to terminal_id and transaction_ref)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Terminal Not Found
**Error:** "No payment terminal is configured for this location"
**Solution:**
1. Verify terminal is registered for the location
2. Check terminal status is "active"
3. Run test connection: `POST /flora-im/v1/pos-terminals/{id}/test`

### Payment Declined
**Check:**
1. Review `response_code` in transaction log
2. Common codes:
   - `000` = Approved
   - `100` = Declined
   - `902` = Invalid card
3. Check merchant account is active
4. Verify terminal has network connection

### API Connection Failed
**Check:**
1. Verify `dejavoo_register_id` is correct
2. Verify `dejavoo_auth_key` is correct
3. Check API endpoint is reachable
4. Review WordPress error logs
5. Test with Dejavoo sandbox first

### Transaction Not Logging
**Check:**
1. Database tables created successfully
2. WordPress plugin activated
3. Check PHP error logs
4. Verify foreign key constraints
