# Audit & Restock Fix - Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The audit and restock completion buttons were not working because:
1. The `onClick` handler was not properly handling async functions
2. Missing error handling caused silent failures
3. Type mismatch between function signatures and prop types

### Changes Made

#### 1. ProductAuditTable.tsx
- **Fixed prop type**: Changed `onCompleteSession?: () => void` to `onCompleteSession?: () => Promise<void> | void`
- **Improved onClick handler**: Added async wrapper with try-catch and comprehensive logging
- **Added error detection**: Now logs if onCompleteSession is undefined

#### 2. AdjustmentsGrid.tsx  
- **Enhanced applyAuditAdjustments**: Added validation, logging at every step, and better error messages
- **Enhanced applyRestockAdjustments**: Added validation, logging, and error handling
- **Improved error logging**: Added detailed console logs with emojis for easy debugging

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Audit Mode (Complete Audit)

1. **Start the application** and navigate to Adjustments view
2. **Select "Audit" mode** from the dropdown in the header
3. **Add adjustments** to at least 2-3 products by clicking +/- buttons or typing values
4. **Enter audit details**:
   - Audit Name: "Test Audit [Current Date]" (REQUIRED)
   - Description: "Testing audit completion" (Optional)
5. **Open browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) to see logs
6. **Click "Complete Audit" button**

#### Expected Console Output:
```
🚀 Starting Audit completion...
🚀 [Audit] applyAuditAdjustments called
📊 [Audit] Pending adjustments: 3
📝 [Audit] Audit name state: Test Audit [Date]
📝 [Audit] Custom name param: undefined
📝 [Audit] Final audit name: Test Audit [Date]
🔄 [Audit] Applying audit "Test Audit [Date]" with 3 adjustments...
📦 [Audit] API response: {...}
✅ [Audit] Batch adjustment completed
🔄 [Audit] Force refreshing inventory data after audit...
✅ [Audit] Inventory refresh complete
🏁 [Audit] applyAuditAdjustments finished, isApplying=false
✅ Audit completed successfully
```

#### Expected UI Behavior:
- Button shows "Processing..." spinner during execution
- Success message appears: "Success, audit [AUDIT-XXXX] created"
- Inventory counts update immediately
- Audit form clears (name, description, adjustments)
- Button returns to "Complete Audit" state

#### If Something Goes Wrong:
- Console will show detailed error with ❌ emoji
- Error message will appear in UI with specific issue
- Check API response in Network tab for 400/500 errors

### Test 2: Restock Mode (Complete Purchase Order)

1. **Select "Purchase Order" mode** from the dropdown
2. **Add products to restock** by entering quantities (use + to increase, - to decrease, or type directly)
3. **Enter PO details**:
   - Purchase Order Name: "Test PO [Current Date]" (REQUIRED - this is the supplier name)
   - Description: "Testing PO completion" (Optional)
4. **Open browser console** to see logs
5. **Click "Complete Purchase Order" button**

#### Expected Console Output:
```
🚀 Starting Purchase Order completion...
🚀 [Restock] applyRestockAdjustments called
📊 [Restock] Pending products: 3
📝 [Restock] Supplier name: Test PO [Date]
✅ [Restock] Creating PO...
📦 Updating stock levels for restocked products...
✅ Stock levels updated successfully
💾 Stored restock metadata
✅ Purchase Order completed successfully
```

#### Expected UI Behavior:
- Button shows "Processing..." spinner
- Success message: "Success, purchase order PO-XXXX created"
- Stock levels update immediately with restock quantities
- Form clears completely
- Button returns to "Complete Purchase Order" state

### Test 3: Error Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Missing Name
1. Enter audit/restock mode
2. Add adjustments/products
3. **Leave name field EMPTY**
4. Click complete button

**Expected**: Button should be DISABLED (gray) with message "Enter a name to continue"

#### Scenario B: No Adjustments
1. Enter audit/restock mode
2. Enter a name but **don't add any adjustments**
3. Try to click complete button

**Expected**: Button should be DISABLED with message "Add adjustments to continue"

#### Scenario C: API Error Simulation
If API returns an error:
- Console shows: `❌ [Audit] API error response: [error details]`
- UI shows: "Failed to create audit: [specific error message]"
- Button re-enables so user can try again
- Adjustments are NOT cleared (user can fix and retry)

## Debug Tips

If issues persist:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for logs starting with 🚀, ✅, or ❌
2. **Check Network Tab**: Look for calls to `/api/inventory/batch-adjust` (audit) or `/api/inventory/adjust` (restock)
3. **Verify Mode**: Ensure `isAuditMode` or `isRestockMode` is true in console
4. **Check Function Binding**: Console should show "onCompleteSession is not defined!" if function isn't passed
5. **API Response**: Check if WordPress API returns 200 status

## Additional Notes

- Both audit and restock now have identical validation and error handling
- All async operations are properly awaited
- Type errors have been resolved (Promise<void> vs void)
- Comprehensive logging makes debugging much easier
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
