# Cannabis-Specific Dashboard KPIs

## Why Cannabis is Different

Traditional retail dashboards don't account for:
- **Perishable nature** - Cannabis ages and loses potency
- **Compliance requirements** - Product age tracking is critical
- **Category dynamics** - Flower vs Concentrates vs Edibles have different margins/velocity
- **Customer preferences** - Strain types, effects, and potency matter
- **Fast-moving landscape** - What's hot changes quickly

---

## New Cannabis KPIs Added

### 1. **Fast Movers** (7-Day Window) üî•
**What it shows:** Number of products with sales in the last 7 days  
**Why it matters:** Cannabis trends change fast - this tells you what's hot RIGHT NOW  
**Staff action:** Stock up on fast movers, promote slow movers  

**Example:**
- Fast Movers: **15** products (out of 38 in stock)
- Tells staff: 40% of inventory is actively moving, 60% needs attention

---

### 2. **Product Mix** (Category Breakdown) üìä

**What it shows:** Visual breakdown of your inventory by category  
**Metrics per category:**
- Product count (how many SKUs)
- Total value ($ tied up in each category)
- Units sold (90-day velocity)

**Why it matters:**
- **Margin management** - Concentrates typically have higher margins than flower
- **Compliance** - Different categories have different regulations
- **Customer preferences** - Know if you're overstocked in one category

**Example Display:**
```
Concentrate        Edibles           Flower            Vape
   15 products        8 products       10 products      5 products
   $18.2k value      $8.4k value      $12.1k value     $2.9k value
   420 units sold    156 units sold   312 units sold   89 units sold
```

**Staff insights:**
- "We have too much capital in Concentrates - maybe discount slow movers"
- "Flower is selling well but low inventory value - restock opportunity"
- "Edibles are underperforming - review pricing or promotions"

---

### 3. **Inventory Health Score** (Compliance Focus) ‚úÖ

**Enhanced with cannabis age tracking:**
- **Fresh (0-7 days):** New stock, peak quality
- **Aging (7-14 days):** Still good, normal sell window
- **Stale (14-21 days):** Needs attention, consider promotion
- **Old (21+ days):** Compliance risk, urgent action needed

**Cannabis-specific actions:**
- Fresh: Premium pricing, feature in displays
- Aging: Standard operations
- Stale: 10-15% discount to move
- Old: Deep discount or return to supplier (if possible)
