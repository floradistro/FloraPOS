## Technical Flow

### Architecture

```
ProductDashboard (Dashboard insights)
         â†“
  onDashboardAction callback
         â†“
  page.tsx (handleDashboardAction)
         â†“
  Sets: view, mode, filters
         â†“
  AdjustmentsGrid (Pre-configured)
```

### State Management

**handleDashboardAction** in `page.tsx`:
```typescript
{
  type: 'audit' | 'restock',  // What mode to activate
  filter?: {
    category?: string,         // Filter by category name
    search?: string,           // Search term
    mode?: 'aging' | 'lowStock' | 'category'  // Filter context
  }
}
```

**Examples:**

**1. Aging Products Audit:**
```typescript
onDashboardAction({
  type: 'audit',
  filter: { mode: 'aging' }
})
```
Result: Audit mode ON, view switches, ready to count

**2. Category Audit (Concentrates):**
```typescript
onDashboardAction({
  type: 'audit',
  filter: { 
    category: 'Concentrate',
    mode: 'category'
  }
})
```
Result: Audit mode ON, filtered to Concentrates only

**3. Low Stock Restock:**
```typescript
onDashboardAction({
  type: 'restock',
  filter: { mode: 'lowStock' }
})
```
Result: Restock mode ON, ready to add quantities

## Visual Design (Apple-Style)

### Hover States
- **Subtle hover:** Background lightens slightly
- **Arrow animation:** Slides right on hover
- **Color transition:** Text shifts to accent color
- **No jarring changes:** Smooth, 300ms transitions

### Clickable Indicators
- **Right arrow (â†’)** appears on hover
- **Group hover effects:** Whole card responds as one
- **Disabled state:** Grayed out, no pointer cursor when count = 0

### Feedback
- **Instant navigation:** No loading states
- **Context preserved:** You know why you're in audit mode
- **Smooth transitions:** Apple-style easing curves

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Smart Filtering
- **Age filter:** When clicking "Review Now", only show aging products
- **Stock threshold:** Low stock click shows products with stock â‰¤ 5
- **Recent sales:** Fast movers click shows products sold in last 7 days

### Phase 3: Breadcrumbs
```
Dashboard â†’ Audit Mode â†’ Concentrates (15 products)
              â†‘
      [Back to Dashboard]
```

### Phase 4: Quick Actions
- Right-click category â†’ "Audit" or "Restock"
- Keyboard shortcuts: `A` for audit, `R` for restock
- Command palette: `Cmd+K` â†’ "Audit Concentrates"

---

## Benefits

### For Staff
- **Faster actions:** 5 steps â†’ 2 steps
- **Less confusion:** Clear path from insight to action
- **No context switching:** Dashboard tells you what to do, action is one click away

### For Operations
- **Reduced errors:** Pre-filtered views = less chance of missing products
- **Better compliance:** Easy audit access = more frequent stock counts
- **Data-driven:** Actions based on real insights, not guesses

### For Management
- **Efficiency gains:** 30-60 seconds saved per action Ã— 20 actions/day = 10-20 min/day saved
- **Higher adoption:** Easier to use = staff actually uses it
- **Better inventory health:** Quick action on aging products = less waste

## User Experience Principles

### 1. **Show, Don't Tell**
Instead of "You have aging products" â†’ "Review Now" (action)

### 2. **One-Click Actions**
No multi-step processes. See problem â†’ Click â†’ Solve.

### 3. **Context Preservation**
When you arrive in audit mode, you remember why you're there

### 4. **Visual Feedback**
Hover, click, transition - every action has smooth feedback

### 5. **Progressive Enhancement**
Works without JavaScript? Basic functionality still there.
