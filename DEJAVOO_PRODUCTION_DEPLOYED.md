## ⚠️ Next Step: Dejavoo API Endpoint

The terminal is configured, but we need the **correct Dejavoo cloud API endpoint** for WizarPOS Q2 terminals.

### What's Needed

**Contact Dejavoo Support to get:**
1. Correct API endpoint URL for WizarPOS Q2 cloud terminals
2. API authentication method (if different from RegisterID/AuthKey)
3. Any additional API documentation

**Dejavoo Support:**
- Website: https://www.dejavoo.com
- Support: Check your merchant portal
- Documentation: https://app.theneo.io/dejavoo/spin/spin-rest-api-methods

**We tried:**
- ❌ `https://api.dejavoo.com` - SSL/TLS error
- ❌ `https://spin.dejavoo.com` - SSL/TLS error
- ❌ `http://tran.cloudpos.com` - Host not found
- ❌ `http://x1.cloudpay.com` - Host not found
- ❌ `http://192.168.1.229:8080` - Local network (not accessible from cloud)

**Likely correct endpoint format:**
- Could be `https://cloud.dejavoo.com` or similar
- May need specific authentication headers
- Might require OAuth or different auth method

### How to Update Once You Have the Endpoint

**Option 1: Via Database**
```bash
ssh -p 18765 u2736-pgt6vpiklij1@gvam1142.siteground.biz
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u unr9f5qnxgdfb -p dbpm1080lhrpq2

UPDATE avu_flora_payment_processors 
SET api_endpoint='CORRECT_ENDPOINT_HERE' 
WHERE id=1;
```

**Option 2: Via API**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-im/v1/payment-processors/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api_endpoint":"CORRECT_ENDPOINT_HERE"}'
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Once Endpoint is Correct

### Test Connection
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-im/v1/pos-terminals/3/test"
```

### Test $1.00 Sale
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/flora-im/v1/payment/sale" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "terminal_id": 3,
    "amount": 1.00,
    "invoice_number": "TEST-001"
  }'
```

**Expected Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "transaction_id": 1,
  "response": {
    "TransactionID": "...",
    "ResponseCode": "000",
    "ResponseMessage": "APPROVED",
    "ApprovalCode": "...",
    "CardType": "VISA",
    "CardLast4": "1234"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Frontend Integration (Next.js)

Once the API endpoint is correct, the frontend in Next.js will automatically:
1. Load the terminal when opening checkout
2. Send card payments to Dejavoo via your terminal
3. Display approval/decline messages
4. Store transaction references with orders

**No frontend changes needed** - it's already integrated!

## 📊 Current System Architecture

```
POS Checkout (Next.js)
    ↓
WordPress API (/flora-im/v1/payment/sale)
    ↓
Dejavoo Client (class-flora-im-dejavoo-client.php)
    ↓
[NEEDS CORRECT ENDPOINT] → Dejavoo Cloud API
    ↓
WizarPOS Q2 Terminal (192.168.1.229)
    ↓
Card Presented by Customer
    ↓
← Approval/Decline Response
```

## 📝 What You Have Right Now

✅ **Database schema** - All tables created  
✅ **Terminal registered** - WP42601Q43200268 configured  
✅ **Backend code** - All PHP classes deployed  
✅ **API endpoints** - All REST routes active  
✅ **Frontend code** - CheckoutScreen integrated  
✅ **Credentials stored** - RegisterID & AuthKey in database  

⚠️ **Missing**: Correct Dejavoo cloud API endpoint

---

## 🆘 Alternative: Direct Terminal Integration

If Dejavoo cloud API doesn't work, you can integrate directly with the terminal:

### Option A: Terminal SDK
WizarPOS terminals have a local SDK that can be integrated

### Option B: Terminal IP Communication
If on same network as POS, communicate directly with terminal IP

### Option C: Dejavoo's Semi-Integration
Use Dejavoo's pre-built terminal interface instead of cloud API

**Recommendation**: Contact Dejavoo support first to get proper cloud API endpoint. This is the cleanest solution.
