# 🚨 INVENTORY WIPE BUG - FINAL FIX

## Problem Observed
- Watermelon Gummy: 15 units → Sold 1 → **Now 0 units** ❌
- Should be: 15 - 1 = 14 units ✅

## Root Cause
**Multi-layer caching is still returning stale inventory data!**

### What's Happening
```
1. Product has 15 units in database
2. Earlier today it had 0 units  
3. Browser/proxy/React Query cached that "0"
4. During checkout:
   - GET inventory → Returns CACHED "0" ❌
   - Calculate: 0 - 1 = -1 → clamped to 0
   - UPDATE inventory to: 0
5. Result: Inventory wiped!
```

## The Fix

### Added to `inventory-deduction-service.ts`:

1. **Timestamp in URL** - Forces unique request every time
```typescript
_t: Date.now().toString() // Millisecond-precision cache busting
```

2. **No-Cache Headers** - Prevents browser caching
```typescript
headers: {
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
  'Pragma': 'no-cache',
  'Expires': '0'
}
```

3. **Backend Already Fixed** - Proxy route doesn't cache inventory

## How It Works Now

```
BEFORE (Broken):
GET /inventory?product_id=676&location_id=20
  → Browser cache: "0" (from 5 minutes ago)
  → Deduct: 0 - 1 = 0
  → WIPED!

AFTER (Fixed):
GET /inventory?product_id=676&location_id=20&_t=1760642321456
  → Fresh request (unique URL)
  → Cache-Control: no-cache headers
  → Backend: no-store cache strategy
  → Returns: 15 units (REAL data!)
  → Deduct: 15 - 1 = 14 ✅
```

## Testing

**Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R) and make a sale. Watch console:
```
📊 Checking current stock...
📊 Current stock: 15.00 ← Should show REAL inventory, not 0!
📝 Updating inventory: 15.00 → 14.00
✅ Successfully deducted inventory
```

---

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED**  
**Action**: **HARD REFRESH BROWSER NOW**  
**Test**: Make a sale and verify inventory goes 15 → 14 (not 15 → 0)
