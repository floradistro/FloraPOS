# ✅ LOCATION TAX FIX - COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
Orders showed wrong taxes in WordPress:
- POS displayed 3 taxes (TN State 7%, TN Hemp 6%, TN Local 2.75%) = **$2.36 total**
- WordPress showed 1 tax (NC Sales 8%) = **$1.20 total** ❌

### Solution
1. **Removed hemp tax filter** in CheckoutScreen.tsx - was excluding non-standard tax classes
2. **Routed orders to Flora IM API** - better control over tax handling
3. **Added tax preservation logic** - prevents WooCommerce from recalculating
4. **Simplified orders dashboard** - removed broken date filters

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/ui/CheckoutScreen.tsx` - Line 147: Removed tax class filter
- `/src/components/ui/OrdersDashboard.tsx` - Line 70: Simplified order fetching
