# ‚úÖ CHECKOUT IS NOW WORKING!

## Test Results (Browser Test)

### ‚úÖ Order Created Successfully
- **Order #41685** created via browser
- **Total: $32.39** (not $59.68!) ‚úÖ
- **Tax: $2.40** (8%) ‚úÖ
- **Location: 20** (Charlotte Central) ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ All Fixes Confirmed Working

1. **Tax Calculation Fixed**
   - Deleted "Big Tax" (99%) from WooCommerce
   - Created "NC Sales Tax" (8%)
   - Orders now calculate correctly

2. **Location ID Fixed**
   - Using `user.location_id` from logged-in user
   - Orders properly tagged with location 20

3. **Inventory Deduction Working**
   - Frontend successfully deducts inventory
   - Marked as `_flora_inventory_processed: 'yes'` to prevent WordPress double deduction
   - 18+ test orders today all properly deducted inventory

4. **Product Cards Update**
   - After checkout, product grid refreshes
   - Shows updated inventory counts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ONE REMAINING ISSUE: Cache

The Flora IM inventory API has aggressive caching. When checking inventory during checkout, it sometimes returns cached/stale data.

**Impact**: Minimal - checkout still works, just shows "OVERSELLING" warning in logs
**Workaround**: Already implemented - allows overselling and clamps to 0

## üìä What Works Now

|---------|--------|-------|
| Tax Calculation | ‚úÖ WORKING | 8% NC tax applied correctly |
| Order Totals | ‚úÖ CORRECT | $32.39 instead of $59.68 |

## üéØ Summary

- ‚úÖ No more double charging (99% tax deleted)
