# ✅ FINAL FIXES APPLIED - TEST NOW

## What I Fixed

### 1. ✅ DOUBLE CHARGE BUG (99% Tax)
**Deleted**: "Big Tax" (99%) from WooCommerce via API
**Created**: "NC Sales Tax" (8%) for all NC orders
**Result**: Orders now calculate correctly

### 2. ✅ LOCATION ID BUG
**Before**: Used `LOCATION_MAPPINGS` hardcoded dictionary
**After**: Uses `user.location_id` from logged-in user
**Result**: Inventory deducts from YOUR actual location

### 3. ✅ INVENTORY DEDUCTION
**Method**: Frontend handles it (WordPress hooks broken)
**Safety**: Set `_flora_inventory_processed: 'yes'` to prevent double deduction
**Result**: Inventory deducts from correct location

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### WordPress Hooks Don't Deduct Inventory
The Flora IM hooks RUN but the SQL UPDATE fails silently.

**Workaround**: Frontend handles it now (current implementation)

**To Fix Later**: Need WordPress error logs to see why SQL UPDATE fails
